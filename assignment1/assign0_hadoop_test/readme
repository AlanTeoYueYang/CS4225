############### Assignment 0: Hadoop Test #####################

You only need to add your matric ID and name in comments. 

Use scripts to compile and submit your codes
$ ./compile_run		# compile and run your code on sample dataset, check the result
$ ./submit		# submit your codes (You can submit multiple times before due time)
These scripts will also be used on marking. So ensure your output format is the same as 'answer.txt'

In this assignment, you should ONLY modify:
-- WordCount.java

Do NOT add new files.
