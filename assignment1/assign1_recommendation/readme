############### Assignment 1-2: Recommendation  #####################

Command Format: Recomend <input_file> <output_dir>
Example: hadoop jar cf.jar Recommend recommendation/input/data.csv recommendation/output
(All the file path in the command is HDFS path)
The output should be stored in a text file recommendation/output/part-r-00000 by default.

Use scripts to compile and submit your codes
$ ./compile_run		# compile and run your code on sample dataset, check the result
$ ./submit		# submit your codes (You can submit multiple times before due time)
These scripts will also be used on marking. So ensure your output format is the same as 'answer.txt'

In this assignment, you should ONLY modify:
-- src
|-- Recommend.java
|-- (You can add other java files)

Do NOT define Java packages. The script compiles everything under 'src/' as simple java files.
